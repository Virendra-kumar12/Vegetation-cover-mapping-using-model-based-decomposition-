# Vegetation-cover-mapping-using-model-based-decomposition-
Developed a novel model-based decomposition method for precise vegetation cover mapping using microwave remote sensing. Utilized Stokes parameters and the covariance matrix to differentiate between single bounce, double bounce, and volume scattering mechanisms.
